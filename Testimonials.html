                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    "So sorry we had to go home after only one night. We will definitely stay two nights next time!"<br /><br />
                    "This apartment is close to everything. We didn't need the car as the walks were amazing"<br /><br />
                    "Your attention to detail made our stay so relaxed and comfortable. It was such a shame we had to drive back to our little flat, which is smaller than your apartment. We want to move in!"<br /><br />
                    "Cosy and comfortable. We imagined we owned it and enjoyed being spoilt.  Thank you."<br /><br />
                    "What a magical stay at such an amazing place. Completely self-contained and very private. We loved it and will return again and again."<br /><br />
                    "Never felt so spoilt. A perfect get away and so close to everything. We had the best bath ever!"<br /><br />
                    "A few minutes’ walk from the beach, picnic basket in hand and towel over the shoulder - can't think of anything better except that wonderful breakfast. That bacon is the best in Melbourne!"<br /><br />
                    Relaxing in that sunny garden watching our dog chasing balls. Let me stay forever!"<br /><br />
